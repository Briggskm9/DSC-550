DCS 550 Data Mining
Recalls on products happen when a large quantity of items are no longer safe for use.  Items that are frequently recalled are vehicles, medications, 
foods, and products (i.e. small choking hazards for infants).  There are a various amount of information on recalls located at data.gov and https://www.recalls.gov/ that 
I would like to mine and find the most frequent recalls on food.  I would also like to know which class of medications are the most recalled.  
Along with frequent itemset mining, I would also conduct rare itemset mining.  Hopefully, I can find patterns that are rarely seen.  

Research
The data that I would like to research involves:
1) What food items are most frequently recalled and what cause?
2) What part of a vehicle is most frequently recalled?
3) What class of prescription medication is most frequently recalled?
4) What consumer product is rarely recalled?  Which category is most recalled?
